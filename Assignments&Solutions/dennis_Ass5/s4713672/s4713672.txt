Feedback: 
Hand in the notebook (and nothing else) named as follows: StudentName1_snumber_StudentName2_snumber.ipynb

5.2.2: "It is logical that return of the jedi and star wars are associated, but toy story is kind of a weird addition.": In this case you should explain, why this was returned as a strong association, despite of being weird in your eyes.
5.2.3: Confidence is not the problem, but support.
5.3.1: Proof is missing
5.3.2: Phi-coefficient table 2 is incorrect; Conclusion is missing
