Feedback:
Maybe the upload of the grades won't work, because you didn't give me the full name of D. Anthes. In the case that only Melle got a grade, please write me an E-Mail with the full-name and student number again.
Hand in the notebook (and nothing else) named as follows: StudentName1_snumber_StudentName2_snumber.ipynb

5.3.1.2: The Lift is p(B|A)/P(B), I guess you mixed up conf (a -> b) = p(b|a) with p(a|b)
5.3.1.4: Very nice proof

Your notebook was nicely structured and easy to read.
