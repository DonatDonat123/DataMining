Feedback:

5.3.1: If you use abbrevations like P1, P2 etc, than you have to specify them somewhere. Also just by enumerating properties, you don't conclude whether the association is good or not; Proof is missing
5.3.2: Also describe/interprete what it means, if e.g values are increasing for different measures.
