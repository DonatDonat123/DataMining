Feedback:

5.2.3: "people dont tend to buy more than three items": This is not the reason
5.2.4: Your answer is vague/incorrect.
5.3.1.1/2: The formulars you use are correct but the results are wrong: 2/3 != 0.8
5.3.1.4: The notation of your proof is insufficient. 
5.3.2: Conclusion should be more elaborate. The presentation of your results is really hard to read.
