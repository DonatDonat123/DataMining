Feedback:

Hand in the notebook (and nothing else) named as follows: StudentName1_snumber_StudentName2_snumber.ipynb

6.1.1: 4 Neighbors is not always the best number, you should have tried different values.
6.1.2: Your code seems allright, but you don't have any output.
6.1.3: Forgot to plot the mean squared error
6.2.3 and Rest: Missing
