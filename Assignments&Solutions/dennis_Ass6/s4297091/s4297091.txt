Feedback:

6.1.1: Forgot to calculate accuracy and error-rate. 
6.1.1: Choosing k=1 is like cheating, because you classify each data-point with its own true class. You should use a Train-Test split. I didn't substract any points for this.

6.1.2: "Plot the cross-validation average classification error as a function of k for k=1,..,40k=1,..,40.". But your results are correct.
6.1.3: Missing
6.2.2ff: Missing
